An illustrated screenplay crossing Star Wars Ep. I,

the real world online/offline life in 2010s/2020s, Wayne's World, etc.
that aims to launch the Padmé-verse world, and more generally
pave way for commercial crossover/RPF fanart, reverse copyright
maximalism and convert Hollywood to the open/free/amateur model:

<strong>Dedication</strong>

This story is dedicated to the memory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie">Christina Grimmie (1994-2016)</a>,
a remarkable singer and youtuber, who was killed at age 22 by a fan who was obsessed with her, who almost immediately committed suicide himself.

For what I consider her Magnus Opus see her original
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYX8sjIzjGw">"Feelin' Good" song</a>
whose message I believe is

«
Be confident. Do the best you can given the time frame.
It doesn't have to be perfect. You are allowed to be wrong and say wrong things
that you think will still impress people. Try to learn from your mistakes,
<a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/">encourage the critics</a>
and try to improve, but realise that <a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Never_Try_to_Please_Everyone/">some
people will always be unhappy</a> and hold you liable for your past opinions, past mistakes,
past failures, opinions that they disagree with, your non-normative behaviour,
your qualities (age, gender, country, city, ethnicity, religion, ideology,
beliefs, wealth, image, personality, cultural tastes, etc.) and your works.

You will likely "fail" to become the "next biggest thing", but even if you
do, you can at least fail "in style" and inspire even <a href="https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9B%D7%9C_%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A0%D7%A4%D7%A9_%D7%90%D7%97%D7%AA">one person</a>.

Always remember: you are awesome. You can become more awesome, regardless
of any "IQ" myths. But you can one day <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/ongoing-text.html#summer_glau_presents__the_talk__amateur_fighters">"lose"</a> to someone less qualified than you.
That's OK - <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Buffy/A-Few-Good-Slayers/ongoing-text.html#becky_in_the_library__chit_chat">you
can learn from a lost fight</a> and make
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/my-real-person-fan-fiction/#actors_are_unique">a comeback</a> but
frankly heroes do not die ("reputationally" at least) - they accumulate.

As the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKrmDLvijo">Indiana Jones' gun vs, sword</a>
scene shows, if something takes too long or seems too risky, then think outside
the box, challenge the invisible rules, "hack" something, or even temporarily
or permanently give
up. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it">There's more than one way to do it</a>
(even <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/proofs-of-the-pythagorean-theorem/">in maths</a> and
when writing Python code) and different people like different things.

<a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala">Queen Padmé Amidala of the Nabii</a> (Star Wars Ep. 1, played by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Alvord">Tiffany Alvord</a>) is in a corridor with the young
<a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>
and his jedi mentor ( <a

her with light sabers. On the ends there are two armored but unarmed <a
href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Klingon">Klingon</a> (Star Trek)
: <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Worf">Worf</a>
and <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Gowron">Gowron</a>
warriors who fight against a metric ton of &quot;throwaway&quot; lightsabered
jedi warriors who rush from the middle to try to take the malevolent Klingons
out of the equation somehow. The Klingons have immense strength, agility, and
stamina, and use basic and advanced martial arts tactics: kicking the jedis in
the crotch; poking their eyes out, stabbing them with their own lightsabers,
pushing them onto each other's laser swords in cascade, etc.

Eventually the lesser Jedis are all dead or wounded, and the Klingons rush towards the trio screaming battle cries. The queen looks startled and frightened while Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are trying to prepare tensely and without much hope to win.

The queen's face becomes tense and focused, she pulls two small crossbows from
her waist, looks to her right, aims, and shoots an arrow at the Klingon
warrior's forehead; then she turns her head to the left, aims and shoots. The
crossbows' arrows pass through the two Klingons' warriors foreheads, who
quickly faint and fall forward, dead.

The two Jedis protagonists are relieved, laugh, disable their lightsabers' laser blades, high five and huggle the queen. The queen smiles, hands them the crossbows to study and they examine one crossbow each, discussing them with the queen.

A tagline appears on the screen as a mock commercial:

<strong>PersonalQrossBow's 2-in-1 Pocketbow kit. Why not have both?</strong>

Natalie Portman's voice from behind: and — cut! Great job everyone!

[

The actors of Worf and Gowron rise from their place. Tiffany Alvord
is smiling relieved and shakes hands the of the 4 male actors
and hugs them compassionately. Natalie Portman (= the director)
does the same.

Natalie [to Tiffany]: I knew you had it in you.
