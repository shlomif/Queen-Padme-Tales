the real world online/offline life in 2010s/2020s, Wayne's World, etc.
that aims to launch the Padmé-verse world, and more generally
pave way for commercial crossover/RPF fanart, reverse copyright
maximalism and convert Hollywood to the open/free/amateur model:

<strong>Dedication</strong>

This story is dedicated to the memory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie">Christina Grimmie (1994-2016)</a>,
a remarkable singer and youtuber, who was killed at age 22 by a fan who was obsessed with her, who almost immediately committed suicide himself.

For what I consider her Magnus Opus see her original
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYX8sjIzjGw">"Feelin' Good" song</a>
whose message I believe is

«
Be confident. Do the best you can given the time frame.
It doesn't have to be perfect. You are allowed to be wrong and say wrong things
that you think will still impress people. Try to learn from your mistakes,
<a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/">encourage the critics</a>
and try to improve, but realise that <a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Never_Try_to_Please_Everyone/">some
people will always be unhappy</a> and hold you liable for your past opinions, past mistakes,
past failures, opinions that they disagree with, your non-normative behaviour,
your qualities (age, gender, country, city, ethnicity, religion, ideology,
beliefs, wealth, image, personality, cultural tastes, etc.) and your works.

You will likely "fail" to become the "next biggest thing", but even if you
do, you can at least fail "in style" and inspire even <a href="https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9B%D7%9C_%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A0%D7%A4%D7%A9_%D7%90%D7%97%D7%AA">one person</a>.

Always remember: you are awesome. You can become more awesome, regardless
of any "IQ" myths. But you can one day <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/ongoing-text.html#summer_glau_presents__the_talk__amateur_fighters">"lose"</a> to someone less qualified than you.
That's OK - <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Buffy/A-Few-Good-Slayers/ongoing-text.html#becky_in_the_library__chit_chat">you
can learn from a lost fight</a> and make
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/my-real-person-fan-fiction/#actors_are_unique">a comeback</a> but
frankly heroes do not die ("reputationally" at least) - they multiply.
