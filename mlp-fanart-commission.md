# Commission: Fluttershy as Queen Amidala - vs. the Klingon Warriors (David and Goliath modernisation)

This is an idea for a next logical evolution of
[David vs. Goliath](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/DocBook5/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/david_and_goliath.xhtml) / [Indiana Jones' gun vs. swordsman scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YyBtMxZgQs) / missile weapon vs. melee story structure.

I wish to commission such a video and am willing to pay a reasonable amount of
money for a CC-by licensed final video (in .mp4, .webm or a different documented
format). If you charge by hour take your time estimate and multiply it
by [Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi) (or somtimes 2*Pi from my
experience, or round it down to 3 to 6) and multiply by your hourly rate.
I can afford to pay roughly up to 3000 USD using PayPal (after a
pre-agreement).

You can use any assets you wish and make it either using ponies or humans
or any other animals. Feel free to post it to your YouTube channel,
or any other social media.

I've picked [Fluttershy](https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Fluttershy) as Queen Amidala,
because it seems out of her element.

More info about the story, its origin and philosophy can be found

## The Story

<img align="right" src="./6306095903_a5c92746ba_o--tacos-reduced-by-jeffreyw--small-400px.webp" alt="Tacos photo by JeffreyW" />

[Queen Padmé Amidala](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala) (Star Wars Ep. 1) is in a corridor with the young [Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi) and his jedi mentor ( [Qui-Gon Jinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui-Gon_Jinn) ) guarding her with light sabers. On the ends there are two armored but unarmed [Klingon](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Klingon) (Star Trek) warriors who fight against a metric ton of "throwaway" lightsabered jedi knights who rush from the middle to try to take the malevolent Klingons out of the equation somehow. The Klingons have immense strength, agility, and stamina, and use basic and advanced martial arts tactics: kicking the jedis in the crotch; poking their eyes out, stabbing them with their own lightsabers, pushing them onto each other's laser swords in cascade, etc.

Eventually the lesser Jedis are all dead or wounded, and the Klingons rush towards the trio screaming battle cries. The queen looks startled and frightened while Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are trying to prepare tensely and without much hope to win.

The queen's face becomes tense and focused, she pulls two small crossbows from
her waist, looks to her right, aims, and shoots an arrow at the Klingon
warrior's forehead; then she turns her head to the left, aims and shoots. The
crossbows' arrows pass through the two Klingons' warriors foreheads, who
quickly faint and fall forward, dead.

The two Jedis protagonists are relieved, laugh, disable their lightsabers' laser blades, high five and huggle the queen. The queen smiles, hands them the crossbows to study and they examine one crossbow each, discussing them with the queen.

A tagline appears on the screen as a mock commercial:

**PersonalQrossBow's 2-in-1 Pocketbow kit. Why not have both?** ( https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexlee/porque-no-los-dos )

### Note:

PersonalQrossBow is not a real firm as far as we know, and while being a fan of some tacos, I
have not tried the ones in the original commercial, nor did I receive money from
Old El Paso. Nevertheless, I respect and admire their good marketing,
and believe that marketing has been unnecessarily demonised, as it is essential for the success of
your "product" (for lack of a better word) or digital work. Hearing about the meme has
proven a catalyst for writing this story.

In addition, I hereby request [Old El Paso](https://www.oldelpaso.com/) to not sue me,
and if they wish to compensate me for the free publicity, to donate instead to any
one or more of the following organisations:

## Dedication

This story is dedicated to the memory of [Christina Grimmie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie) (1994-2016),
a remarkable singer and youtuber, who was killed at age 22 by a fan who was obsessed with her, who almost immediately committed suicide himself.

## Thanks and Credits

[Bandali](https://github.com/notbandali) for introducing me to the ["Porque no los dos" (= "Why can't we have both?")](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexlee/porque-no-los-dos) meme, which was one of
the final catalysts for writing this.
