<s id="about" title="About this screenplay">

<s id="about-objective" title="Objective">

[

An illustrated screenplay crossing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars%3A_Episode_I_%E2%80%93_The_Phantom_Menace">Star Wars Ep. I</a>,
the <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse">Selinaverse</a> (itself
crossing Star Trek TNG/DS9, Buffy, Judaism, Israel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)">Objectivism</a>, etc.)
the real world online/offline life in 2010s/2020s,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a>.

This screenplay <b>is not</b> written in the Hollywood blessed format because
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/hacking-heroism.xhtml">good
hackers (= resourceful and rule bending heroes)</a>
which include the talented actors and actresses in this film can
withstand reading a raw and non-CSS-styled XHTML5 file. That - and hackers like me
do not have the time to massage a screenplay into Hollywood's whimsical
format only to be rejected, rinse and repeat.

Queen <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala">Padmé Amidala of the Naboo</a>
(Star Wars Ep. 1, played by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Alvord">Tiffany Alvord</a>)
sits in her office next to a desktop PC running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">GNU/Linux</a>.
She sets up a video conference with <a href="https://spaceballs.fandom.com/wiki/Skroob">President Skroob</a> (sitting)
and <a href="https://spaceballs.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Helmet">Dark Helmet</a> (standing).

]

Dark Helmet: hail Skroob!

[ The three including Padmé do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sihBO2Q2QdY">the Spaceballs hand gesture</a> and laugh. ]

Padmé: Hey there! What's new?

Skroob: Hello again, Paddy! Our planet has accepted an oxygation offer from the
Q continuum, but we wish to stabilise the Oxygen levels so we've initiated
enforestation efforts around Planet Spaceball.

Padmé: That's great! Do you need money?

Dark Helmet: Money? We got lots of money! We don't need your money!
You don't have to give us any of your stinkin' money!

[ Padmé laughs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OcM23Hbs5U">Reference</a>. ]

Skroob: Seriously now, Padmé: we need volunteers to plant trees and we can even
pay them. What will be appreciated is your friends and you setting up an example.

Padmé: <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=shlomif-fact-taylor-swift-10">Taytay-style</a>!

Dark Helmet: Precisely, but I suggest you do it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FktDDKNrWjk">your way</a>;
that is: in your own quirky, geeky, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfection#Paradoxes">imperfect</a> way.

+++: Where do you want to start? (Shows a map of Earth's continents.)

Padmé: Hmmm... how about Southern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain">Spain</a>.
Will you take my word as a non-Español?

Skroob: Of course, some of my best friends are not Español.

Padmé: Excellent! I'll invite some Internet friends (and foes!).

Skroob and Dark Helmet: Hail Fluttershy!

Fluttershy: [She gently enters the frame.] Hail me! [She giggles. Inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Be_or_Not_to_Be_%281942_film%29">To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)</a> ]

<s id="sarge-demotivating-speech" title="The Demotivating Speech">

[ "Sarge" is a Spanish-speaking and English-speaking man and speaks in a
(possibly fake) Spanish accent. He is the leader/organiser of the Tree Planters celeb troops. ]

Sarge: Hello, losers! You are the worst of the worst! The bottom of the barrel!
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith">face that sank a thousand
battleships</a>. You are geeky, immature, fame-hungry, attention whoring,
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/paul-graham.html">amateur</a>,
parasite, think-you're-so-sexy, "celebrities", "creators",
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/ongoing-text.html#from-dispeller-to-selina">new age</a>
philosophers / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVvMl1Ig9cY">educators / entertainers</a>.

+++: I hate your guts. You guys suck! Do you understand that?

The Troop: [in unison] Yes sir, we suck sir!

Sarge: Good! Realising you were an idiot is <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-perl-I-was-an-idiot">an
easy problem to fix</a>! So you immediately <a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/99_Problems/">have one less problem</a>.
So how many problems do you have now, eh, soldiers?

The Troop: 98 problems, sir!

Sarge: Great! You might be parasites, but at least you can perform basic arithmetics!

+++: Let's get it straight: while you are volunteers, can leave everytime,
are dressed in casual clothes, and can and often must <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders">refuse superior orders</a>,
and you will be housed in comfortable housing with good privacy -
you are still soldiers! That means you should aim to not only do
a good job, but the best job you can! <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2004/12/06/news-45/">Rosh gadol</a> (= "big-minded")
like our Israeli brothers-in-arm would say, and which, despite
common misconception, was also likely implemented in
<a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2011/top-10-reasons-darth-vader-amazing-project-manager/">Nazi Germany</a> despite their insistence on following
orders (but often to awful consequences).

+++: That doesn't mean you shouldn't <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/hacking-heroism.xhtml">"hack"</a>. On the contrary:
know your strengths and weaknesses, ask others for help,
think outside the box, be resourceful, and aim to be the best
you can given the time.

+++: Note: you have my contact info and you have brought portable
computers, smartphones, or other devices, to your rooms.
If you face a dilemma on any topic whatsoever (even if not related
to planting trees) then join a chat room for our troop, or
even message me in private. ( <a href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1192785494272348162">“He who saves a single soul has saved the world entire”</a>/etc.)

+++: We may be losers, but at least we lose spectacularly, and might "win" 1
out of 5 battles, and do not want our fellow losers to lose. This is whether
because we made them fail, or because we didn't comment on what we considered
their bad tactic or strategy in time (regardless of how silly or wrong we
thought our feedback is).

<s id="shlomif-intro" title="Shlomi Fish Introducing Himself">

Sarge: Anyway, enough with putting you down.

+++: Mr. Shlomi Fish a.k.a "Rindolf"!

shlomif: At your service, sergeant!

Sarge: So… Mr. Fish… is "Shlomi Fish" your real name?

shlomif: As <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/your_name.xhtml">real
as it gets</a> among Jewish Israelis, sir.

Sarge: Do you expect me to believe you?

shlomif: I do not care what a fellow human believes or
suspects, sir. Just what they do, or to a lesser
extent - say.
