<s id="about" title="About this screenplay">

<s id="about-objective" title="Objective">

[

An illustrated screenplay crossing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars%3A_Episode_I_%E2%80%93_The_Phantom_Menace">Star Wars Ep. I</a>,
the <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse">Selinaverse</a> (itself
crossing Star Trek TNG/DS9, Buffy, Judaism, Israel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)">Objectivism</a>, etc.)
the real world online/offline life in 2010s/2020s,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a>.

This screenplay <b>is not</b> written in the Hollywood blessed format because
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/hacking-heroism.xhtml">good
hackers (= resourceful and rule bending heroes)</a>
which include the talented actors and actresses in this film can
withstand reading a raw and non-CSS-styled XHTML5 file. That - and hackers like me
do not have the time to massage a screenplay into Hollywood's whimsical
format only to be rejected, rinse and repeat.

Anakin: I'm the fourth sith? Who is the third, then?

[ Yoda appears on screen. ]

Yoda: the third sith is I. Created the legend of the Sith 2,000 years ago
have I. Tweeted about it now too have I.

[ Tweet by @Yoda: “The third sith is I. Created the legend of the Sith 2,000 years ago
have I. "Master Darth Yoda" call me you can. Or just plain "Yoda"." ]

Anakin: way cool! But shouldn't Darth Yoda be the first Sith then?

Yoda: Matters not Sith number, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Little_Green_Men_(episode)">as much as short-term quarterly gains.</a>

Vader: Do note, however that there are now <b>five</b> Siths.

Anakin: Great! But who is the Fifth Sith then?

Yoda: mystery remain they shall for now.

Anakin: "they"… [ he smiles ]

Padme: I wonder what kissing a Sith feels like.

+++: Anyway: Jedi and Sith or not, Darth Anakin is still my boyfriend, and we're going on a date. Our plan is to try doing crossover <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/">standup comedy / philosophy</a>
