<s id="about" title="About this screenplay">

<s id="about-objective" title="Objective">

[

An illustrated screenplay crossing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars%3A_Episode_I_%E2%80%93_The_Phantom_Menace">Star Wars Ep. I</a>,
the <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse">Selinaverse</a> (itself
crossing Star Trek TNG/DS9, Buffy, Judaism, Israel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)">Objectivism</a>, etc.)
the real world online/offline life in 2010s/2020s,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a>.

This screenplay <b>is not</b> written in the Hollywood blessed format because
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/hacking-heroism.xhtml">good
hackers (= resourceful and rule bending heroes)</a>
which include the talented actors and actresses in this film can
withstand reading a raw and non-CSS-styled XHTML5 file. That - and hackers like me
do not have the time to massage a screenplay into Hollywood's whimsical
format only to be rejected, rinse and repeat.

Anakin: I'm the fourth sith? Who is the third, then?

[ Yoda appears on screen. ]

Yoda: the third sith is I. Created the legend of the Sith 2,000 years ago
have I. Tweeted about it now too have I.

[ Tweet by @Yoda: “The third sith is I. Created the legend of the Sith 2,000 years ago
have I. "Master Darth Yoda" call me you can. Or just plain "Yoda"." ]

Anakin: way cool! But shouldn't Darth Yoda be the first Sith then?

Yoda: Matters not Sith number, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Little_Green_Men_(episode)">as much as short-term quarterly gains.</a>

Vader: Do note, however that there are now <b>five</b> Siths.

Anakin: Great! But who is the Fifth Sith then?

Yoda: mystery remain they shall for now.

Anakin: "they"… [ he smiles ]

Padmé: I wonder what kissing a Sith feels like.

+++: Anyway: Jedi and Sith or not, Darth Anakin is still my boyfriend, and we're going on a date. Our plan is to try doing crossover <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/">standup comedy / philosophy</a> today - both as producers and as attendees.

+++: So adios Uncle Vader, Darth Sidius, Master Yoda…

Yoda: Go forth and multiply-lang.org !

Padmé: Why thank you! Do note that Anakin and I are not in the rush to multiply-dash-lang-dot-org given the prematurity of our relationship.

+++: Just for the record, we have reached <a href="https://explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/540:_Base_System">4th base</a> ("home run"? not too big into baseball).

+++: And… it was good! It was decent… we both could use some practice.

Anakin: [ blushing but content ] You heard the woman… nothing to add as she covered the first 4 bases. Bye all.

[

Padmé and Anakin leave the room.

Yoda is seen chuckling, and the two Siths join him.

[ Padmé and Anakin returned from their date
]

Anakin: heh, we got a lot of cash today…

Padmé: yes, with the milliards of USD that i have in the bank, I
can blow it on hats…

Anakin: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ftmOI5NnI">A truly noble cause!</a>

Padmé: Indeed…

Anakin: You know I think if Jenn Connelly heard your mock up of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(1986_film)"><i>Labyrinth</i></a>, she'd kill you very painfully:

+++: [parodying] "I wish the goblins would come and take you away right now,"

Padmé: well, she'll likely not only kill you for mocking me mocking her, but damn your soul for a thousand years of burning in hell.

[They both laugh.]

Padmé: Who would have thought that being funny can be so sexy! ( <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/hacking_and_amateur__vs__conformism_and_professional.xhtml">Reference</a> )

[ They think for a moment, and then start kissing passionately .

[ Caption: "Later that night" ]

Padmé: wow, that was… great!

Anakin: which base was that?

Padmé: in practice? <a href="https://www.firsttoeleven.com/">First to eleven</a>! I love you.

Anakin: yes, you were great too.

Padmé: Well, you know the old Internet meme: “Jedi in the streets; sith in the sheets.”

Anakin: Yeah. Are you going to tweet about it?

Padmé: Tweet? I'll buy a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl">Super Bowl</a> commercial if you wish.

Anakin: Well, knowing you and your spirit frenemies, it likely will be common knowledge soon anyhow.

+++: Anyway, I'm gonna move to the other room so we won't distract one another too much.

[ before Anakin closes the door. ]

Anakin: good night, Padpad! And by the way, despite appearances to the contrary, you're a sith im the streets, too.

Padmé: thank you!

[ Anakin closes the door. Padmé is lying in bed happy. After several seconds she opens her eyes widely. ]

<s id="what-maketh-a-sith" title="What maketh a sith?">

[ Padmé is walking to her office. ]

Padmé’s Internal Dialogue: I am a Sith. I am the fifth sith. But what does being a sith entail? What maketh a sith? And who will be the sixth sith?

+++: God, this word must have the worst <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology">Phonology</a> ever!

[ Padmé opens the door to her office. She enters, sits next to the computer, types
"what is a sith" ( without the quotes ) into the browser's address bar, and presses
Enter. Her vision becomes blurry and she falls asleep. ]
