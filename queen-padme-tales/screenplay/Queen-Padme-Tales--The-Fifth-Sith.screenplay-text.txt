<s id="about" title="About this screenplay">

<s id="about-objective" title="Objective">

[

An illustrated screenplay crossing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars%3A_Episode_I_%E2%80%93_The_Phantom_Menace">Star Wars Ep. I</a>,
the <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse">Selinaverse</a> (itself
crossing Star Trek TNG/DS9, Buffy, Judaism, Israel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)">Objectivism</a>, etc.)
the real world online/offline life in 2010s/2020s,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a>.

This screenplay <b>is not</b> written in the Hollywood blessed format because
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/hacking-heroism.xhtml">good
hackers (= resourceful and rule bending heroes)</a>
which include the talented actors and actresses in this film can
withstand reading a raw and non-CSS-styled XHTML5 file. That - and hackers like me
do not have the time to massage a screenplay into Hollywood's whimsical
format only to be rejected, rinse and repeat.

[ Anakin and Padmé enter Darth Vader’s office. ]

Anakin: Hey Uncle Vader! Per the emails exchange I sent you, I have decided that
my relationship with Padmé and my other friends and my emotional well-being are
more important than graduating from that cursed jedi school.

+++: So for now here is my lightsaber [hands it to Vader].

Vader: Keep it! It's yours. Anakin, having read that exchange and having forwarded
it to my jedi colleagues, both Master Yoda, and <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Sidious">Emperor Palpatine</a> have approved of you being graduated. The Jedi council has also voted unanimously for that.

+++: All of that is more than enough for you to receive your jedi qualification.

Anakin: Wow! Thanks! [ he hugs Padmé and they are happy. ]

Vader: Yes, we have received several similar reports about your school in the past,
and so requested them to amend their scholastic environment.

+++: That put aside, I have even better news… Anakin, you have become a sith!
The fourth sith, in fact.

</s>

<s id="yoda-as-a-closet-Sith" title="Yoda">

Anakin: I'm the fourth sith? Who is the third, then?

[ Yoda appears on screen. ]

Yoda: the third sith is I. Created the legend of the Sith 2,000 years ago
have I. Tweeted about it now too have I.

[ Tweet by @Yoda: “The third sith is I. Created the legend of the Sith 2,000 years ago
have I. "Master Darth Yoda" call me you can. Or just plain "Yoda"." ]

Anakin: way cool! But shouldn't Darth Yoda be the first Sith then?

Yoda: Matters not Sith number, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Little_Green_Men_(episode)">as much as short-term quarterly gains.</a>

Vader: Do note, however that there are now <b>five</b> Siths.

Anakin: Great! But who is the Fifth Sith then?

Yoda: mystery remain shall they for now.

Anakin: "they"… [ he smiles ]

Padmé: I wonder what kissing a Sith feels like.

+++: Anyway: Jedi and Sith or not, Darth Anakin is still my boyfriend, and we're going on a date. Our plan is to try doing crossover <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/">standup comedy / philosophy</a> today - both as artists and as attendees.

+++: So adios Uncle Vader, Darth Sidius, Master Yoda…

Yoda: Go forth and multiply-lang.org !

Padmé: Why thank you! Do note that Anakin and I are not in the rush to multiply-dash-lang-dot-org given the prematurity of our relationship.

+++: Just for the record, we have reached <a href="https://explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/540:_Base_System">4th base</a> ("home run"? not too big into baseball).

+++: And… it was good! It was decent… we both could use some practice.

Anakin: [ blushing but content ] You heard the woman… nothing to add as she covered the first 4 bases. Bye all.

[

Padmé and Anakin leave the room.

Yoda is seen chuckling, and the two other Siths join him.

[ Padmé and Anakin returned from their date, and are walking towards Padmé's
room.  ]

Anakin: heh, we got a lot of cash today…

Padmé: yes, with the milliards of USD that i have in the bank, I
can blow it on hats…

Anakin: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ftmOI5NnI">A truly noble cause!</a>

Padmé: Indeed…

Anakin: You know I think if Jenn Connelly heard your mock up of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(1986_film)"><i>Labyrinth</i></a>, she'd kill you very painfully:

+++: [parodying] "I wish the goblins would come and take you away right now,"

Padmé: well, she'll likely not only kill you for mocking me mocking her, but damn your soul for a thousand years of burning in hell.

[They both laugh.]

Padmé: Who would have thought that being funny can be so sexy! ( <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/hacking_and_amateur__vs__conformism_and_professional.xhtml">Reference</a> )

[ They think for a moment, and then start kissing passionately .

Padmé: wow, that was… great!

Anakin: which base was that?

Padmé: in practice? <a href="https://www.firsttoeleven.com/">First to eleven</a>! I love you.

Anakin: yes, you were great too.

Padmé: Well, you know the old Internet meme: “Jedi in the streets; sith in the sheets.”

Anakin: Yeah. Are you going to tweet about it?

Padmé: Tweet? I'll buy a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl">Super Bowl</a> commercial if you wish.

Anakin: Well, knowing you and your spirit frenemies, it likely will be common knowledge soon anyhow.

+++: Anyway, I'm gonna move to the other room so we won't distract one another too much.

[ before Anakin closes the door. ]

Anakin: good night, Padpad! And by the way, despite appearances to the contrary, you're a sith in the streets, too.

Padmé: thank you!

[ Anakin closes the door. Padmé is lying in bed happy. After several seconds she opens her eyes widely. ]

[ Padmé is walking to her office. ]

Padmé’s Internal Dialogue: I am a Sith. I am the fifth sith. But what does being a sith entail? What maketh a sith? And who will be the sixth sith?

+++: God, this word must have the worst <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology">Phonology</a> ever!

[ Padmé opens the door to her office. She enters, sits next to the computer, types
"what is a sith" ( without the quotes ) into the browser's address bar, and presses

Discord: And I am running a sophisticated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep learning</a> algorithm on this supercomputer.

Discord: and it runs at a whopping 1,200 micro-FLOPS.

Padmé: that is a very low speed, Discord.

Discord: oh right, I need to press <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_button">the turbo button</a>.

[ He presses a red button and the computer morphs into a more modern / futuristic one.]

Discord: wow! 1.21 peta-Flops.

Padmé: Enter! … oh! Hi, Mr. Q. [they hug]

Q: Hi Padmé! You seem tired, but unusually happy and radiant.

Padmé: well, I had a great night [the spirit friends blink]... a great day and night. Eh, a great day!

[ The spirit friends say "ooh", chuckle, and use their smartphones to tweet. ]

Padmé: fine, go ahead… I don't mind it <b>that</b> much.

+++: anyway, Mr. Q, I've become a sith and I'm trying to figure out what being a sith entails.

Q: well, Darth Padmé, let me give you a spoiler: a sith is a <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacker-monarchs">hacker king or a hacker queen</a>, which is a new name for a messiah, or <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/indiv-nodes/final-scene-with-Q-and-Sisko.xhtml">a Q in the Selinaverse's parlance</a>: an action hero that aims for world saviouring, being a shaker and mover, helping himself and others as well as enjoying himself at the same time, and letting no permanent obstacle stop him.

Padmé: thank you, Mr. Q!

Q: my pleasure. That put aside, I wish to dispense more insights about messiah-hood that the Selinaverse's creator has come up with, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv_University">Tel Aviv University's</a> campus near his home, and I am hoping you'll attend it as well.

+++: but first you'd better rest a little.

Padmé: sure, I'd love to hear these insights. And I do need to rest. Can you wait here?

Q: sure [ he snaps his fingers causing a desk with a computer to materialise.]! And I also have your spirit friends for company and entertainment.

The four siths: hail Darth Padmé!

Padmé: hail me, heh.

Anakin: heh… we got bored waiting for you so the six of us have been
playing Bohnanza. R2 is winning [R2D2 emits a beep of approval.]

Vader: the screenplay writer wanted more money and to watch a live concert
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie">Christina Grimmie</a>
in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramat_Aviv_Gimel">Ramat Aviv Gimel</a>.

Padmé: These are free, right?

Vader: Yes, but he needed 200 ILS in cash to buy snacks.

Padmé: did he get them?

Vader: Yes, Emma Watson gave him 10,000 ILS in 100 * 100 ILS notes.
In person.

Padmé: cool beans.

+++: anyhow, after we will have this episode filmed, everybody will be the sixth sith. Or maybe the fifth sith, or the first sith. One's sith number doesn't matter as much as short-term quarterly gains.

+++: Moreover, I will no longer care too much that my bank balance gets higher. After all, <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=smg-about-giving-back-money-and-time">as the rich are getting richer, the poor are getting richer too</a>.

[ Anakin thumbs up. ]

Padmé: However… note that this whole sleigh-ride has vexed me, so [ the four Spirit friends appear by Padmé's sides; Discord snaps his fingers, and intimidating guns not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEG-jSXbMcY">unlike The Mask</a> materialise ]
