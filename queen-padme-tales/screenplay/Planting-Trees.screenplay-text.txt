<s id="objective" title="Objective">

[

An illustrated screenplay crossing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars%3A_Episode_I_%E2%80%93_The_Phantom_Menace">Star Wars Ep. I</a>,
the <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse">Selinaverse</a> (itself
crossing Star Trek TNG/DS9, Buffy, Judaism, Israel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)">Objectivism</a>, etc.)
the real world online/offline life in 2010s/2020s,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a>.

This screenplay <b>is not</b> written in the Hollywood blessed format because
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/hacking-heroism.xhtml">good
hackers (= resourceful and rule bending heroes)</a>
which include the talented actors and actresses in this film can
withstand reading a raw and non-CSS-styled XHTML5 file. That - and hackers like me
do not have the time to massage a screenplay into Hollywood's whimsical
format only to be rejected, rinse and repeat.

Queen <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala">Padmé Amidala of the Naboo</a>
(Star Wars Ep. 1, played by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Alvord">Tiffany Alvord</a>)
sits in her office next to a desktop PC running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">GNU/Linux</a>.
She sets up a video conference with <a href="https://spaceballs.fandom.com/wiki/Skroob">President Skroob</a> (sitting)
and <a href="https://spaceballs.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Helmet">Dark Helmet</a> (standing)

]

Dark Helmet: hail skroob!

[ The three including Padmé do the hand gesture thing and laugh. ]

Padmé: hey there! What's new?

Skroob: hello again, Paddy! Our planet has accepted an oxygation offer from the
Q continuum, but we wish to stabilise the Oxygen levels so we've initiated
enforestation efforts around Planet Spaceballs.

Padmé: that's great! Do you need money?

Dark Helmet: Money? We got lots of money! We don't need your money!
We don't need your stinkin' money!

[ Padmé laughs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OcM23Hbs5U">reference</a>. ]

Skroob: seriously now Padmé, we need volunteers to plant trees and we can even
pay them. What will be great is your friends and you setting up an example.

Padmé: <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=shlomif-fact-taylor-swift-10">Taytay-style</a>!

Dark Helmet: Precisely, but I suggest you do it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FktDDKNrWjk">your way</a>
in your own quirky, geeky, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfection#Paradoxes">imperfect</a> way.
Where do you want to start? (Shows a map of Earth's continents.)

Padmé: Hmmm... how about Southern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain">Spain</a>.
Will you take my word as a non-Espanol?

Skroob: Of course, some of my best friends are not Espanol.

Padmé: Excellent! I'll invite some Internet friends (and foes!).

[ Skroob and Dark Helmet say it too. ]

Fluttershy: Hail me! [she giggles]

[ "Sarge" is a Spanish-speaking and English-speaking man and speaks in a possibly fake
Spanish accent. He is the leader/organiser of the Tree Planters celeb troops. ]

Sarge: Hello losers! You are the worst of the worst! The bottom of the barrel!
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith">face that sank a thousand
warships</a>. You are geeky, immature, fame-hungry, attention whoring,
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/paul-graham.html">amateur</a>,

+++: I hate your guts. You guys suck! Do you understand that?

The Troop: [in unison] Yes sir, we suck sir!

Sarge: Good! Realising you were an idiot is <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-perl-I-was-an-idiot">an
easy problem to fix</a>! So you immediately <a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/99_Problems/">have one less problem</a>.
So how many problems you have now:

The Troop: 98 problems, sir!
