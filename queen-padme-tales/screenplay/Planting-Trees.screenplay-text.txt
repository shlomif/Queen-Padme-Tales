<s id="objective" title="Objective">

[

An illustrated screenplay crossing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars%3A_Episode_I_%E2%80%93_The_Phantom_Menace">Star Wars Ep. I</a>,
the <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse">Selinaverse</a> (itself
crossing Star Trek TNG/DS9, Buffy, Judaism, Israel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)">Objectivism</a>, etc.)
the real world online/offline life in 2010s/2020s,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a>.

This screenplay <b>is not</b> written in the Hollywood blessed format because
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/hacking-heroism.xhtml">good
hackers (= resourceful and rule bending heroes)</a>
which include the talented actors and actresses in this film can
withstand reading a raw and non-CSS-styled XHTML5 file. That - and hackers like me
do not have the time to massage a screenplay into Hollywood's whimsical
format only to be rejected, rinse and repeat.
