<s id="about" title="About this screenplay">

<s id="about-objective" title="Objective">

[

An illustrated screenplay crossing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars%3A_Episode_I_%E2%80%93_The_Phantom_Menace">Star Wars Ep. I</a>,
the <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse">Selinaverse</a> (itself
crossing Star Trek TNG/DS9, Buffy, Judaism, Israel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)">Objectivism</a>, etc.)
the real world online/offline life in 2010s/2020s,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a>.

This screenplay <b>is not</b> written in the Hollywood blessed format because
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacking-heroism">good
hackers (= resourceful and rule bending heroes)</a>
which include the talented actors and actresses in this film can
withstand reading a raw and non-CSS-styled XHTML5 file. That - and hackers like me
do not have the time to massage a screenplay into Hollywood's whimsical
format only to be rejected, rinse and repeat.

Initial Credits.

<b>Note:</b> it seems likely this screenplay was inspired by
the Muslim
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isra_and_Mi%27raj">ascension to heaven</a>
story, but note that it is not meant to be Islamic canon, and
may be a parody. Assuming the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Rushdie">Salman Rushdie</a> story about death threats against him is correct,
please both cancel them and don't issue ones against me or anyone else.

Padmé is sleeping in her bed. <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Fluttershy">Fluttershy</a>,
<a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Rainbow_Dash">Rainbow Dash</a>,
and <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Twilight_Sparkle">Twilight Sparkle</a>
materialize.

]

Twilight Sparkle: hey Padmé! Wake up!

Padmé: Hey guys!

Twilight Sparkle: Hop on Fluttershy and let's ride.

Padmé: She is far too small for that.

Twilight Sparkle: no worries.

[ Twilight Sparkle uses her magic horn to make Fluttershy larger,
not unlike <a href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Pegasus">Disney's Hercules Pegasus</a>.

Padmé mounts Fluttershy and the quartet flies away.

Twilight Sparkle opens a portal vortex and they fly through it
into north-central
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv">Tel Aviv</a>
at daytime.

After flying for a while,
<a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Discord">Discord</a>
materialises.

]

Discord: unicorn pony magic does not work in the real world… [ he snaps
his fingers and Fluttershy returns to her normal, smaller, size again]
hah hah hah [ he dematerialises. ]

[

The three winged ponies fumble to prevent Padmé from falling to death.
Eventually she falls onto a tent in <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Terminator/Liberation/">Olamot Con</a>, and descends to the ground unkempt,
but mostly unharmed.

Padmé gets up only to see <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a>
looking at her and the three ponies with interest.

]

Shlomi Fish: Padmé? How did you get from the Selinaverse to the real world?
Anyway, nice to meet you [he extends his hand].

[

Padmé wakes up only to see Discord in front of her eyes.

]

Discord: boo!

[

Padmé screams and then wakes up again.

]

Padmé: oh shit!
