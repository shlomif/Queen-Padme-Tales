[

An illustrated screenplay crossing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars%3A_Episode_I_%E2%80%93_The_Phantom_Menace">Star Wars Ep. I</a>,
the <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse">Selinaverse</a> (itself
crossing Star Trek TNG/DS9, Buffy, Judaism, Israel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)">Objectivism</a>, etc.)
the real world online/offline life in 2010s/2020s,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne%27s_World_(film)">Wayne's World</a>,
and
<a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/My_Little_Pony_Friendship_is_Magic">My Little Pony</a>.

It aims to launch the "Queen Padmé Tales" web series (
whose format is
modelled loosely after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ox_Tales">Ox Tales</a>
). It stars <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Alvord">Tiffany Alvord</a> as
<a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala">Queen Padmé Amidala of the Naboo</a>, and which
aims to be directed and costarred by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman_filmography">Natalie Portman</a>.
More ambitiously it aims to pave way for commercial crossover / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_person_fiction">RPF</a> fanart, help reverse copyright
maximalism and convert Hollywood and the film industry at large to the open/free/amateur model ( see <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-cinema--copyright-cannibalism">Copyright Cannibalism</a> ).

We may not succeed, but at least we're going to try.

This screenplay <b>is not</b> written in the Hollywood blessed format because
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/hacking-heroism.xhtml">good
hackers (= resourceful and rule bending heroes)</a>
which include the talented actors and actresses in this film can
withstand reading a raw and non-CSS-styled XHTML5 file. That - and hackers like me
do not have the time to massage a screenplay into Hollywood's whimsical
format only to be rejected, rinse and repeat.

The <b>Dedication</b>:
<img src="images/Christina_Grimmie_in_November_2014--resized.webp" alt="Photo of Christina Grimmie" />

This story is dedicated to the memory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie">Christina Grimmie (1994-2016)</a>,
a remarkable singer and youtuber, who was killed at age 22 by a fan who was
obsessed with her, who almost immediately committed suicide himself.

For what I consider her Magnus Opus see her original
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYX8sjIzjGw">"Feelin' Good" song and videoclip</a>
whose message I believe is:

«

Be confident. Do the best you can given the time frame.
It doesn't have to be perfect. You are allowed to be wrong and say wrong things
that you think will still impress people. Try to learn from your mistakes,
<a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/">encourage the critics</a>
and try to improve, but realise that
<a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Never_Try_to_Please_Everyone/">some people will always be unhappy</a>
and hold you liable for your past opinions, past mistakes,
past failures, opinions that they disagree with, your non-normative behaviour,
your qualities (age, gender, country, city, ethnicity, religion, ideology,
beliefs, wealth, image, personality, cultural tastes, etc.) and your works.

You will likely "fail" to become the "next biggest thing", but even if you
do, you can at least fail "in style" and inspire or help even just <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=mishnah--saving-one-soul">one person</a>.

Always remember: you are awesome. You can become more awesome, regardless
of any "IQ" myths. But you may one day <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/ongoing-text.html#summer_glau_presents__the_talk__amateur_fighters">"lose"</a> to someone less qualified than you.
That's OK - <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Buffy/A-Few-Good-Slayers/ongoing-text.html#becky_in_the_library__chit_chat">you can learn from a lost fight</a> and make
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/my-real-person-fan-fiction/#actors_are_unique">a comeback</a>.
Frankly, heroes do not die ("reputationally" at least) - they accumulate.

As the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKrmDLvijo">Indiana Jones' gun vs, sword</a>
scene shows, if something takes too long or seems too risky, then think outside
the box, challenge the invisible rules, "hack" something, or even temporarily
or permanently give
up. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it">There's more than one way to do it</a>
(even <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/proofs-of-the-pythagorean-theorem/">in maths</a> and
when writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29">Python</a> code) and different people like different things.

Kipling which has a similar message, and is the most favourite poem among
British citizens, a favourite among Israelis, was Ayn Rand’s favourite, and mine.)

Queen <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala">Padmé Amidala of the Naboo</a>
(Star Wars Ep. 1, played by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Alvord">Tiffany Alvord</a>) is in a corridor with the young
<a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>
and his jedi mentor ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui-Gon_Jinn">Qui-Gon Jinn</a> ) guarding
her with light sabers. On the ends there are two armoured but unarmed <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Klingon">Klingon</a> warriors
(Star Trek), <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Worf">Worf</a> and <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Gowron">Gowron</a>,
who fight against a metric ton of &quot;throwaway&quot; lightsabered
jedi warriors who rush from the middle to try to take the malevolent Klingons
out of the equation somehow. The Klingons have immense strength, agility, and
stamina, and use basic and advanced martial arts tactics: kicking the jedis in
the crotch; poking their eyes out, stabbing them with their own lightsabers,
pushing them onto each other's laser swords in cascade, etc.

Eventually the lesser Jedis are all dead or wounded, and the Klingons rush
towards the trio screaming battle cries. The queen looks startled and
frightened while Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are trying to prepare tensely and without
much hope to win.

The queen's face becomes tense and focused, she pulls two small crossbows from
her waist, looks to her right, aims, and shoots an arrow at the Klingon
warrior's forehead; then she turns her head to the left, aims and shoots. The
crossbows' arrows pass through the two Klingons' warriors foreheads, who
quickly faint and fall forward, dead.

The two Jedis protagonists are relieved, laugh, disable their lightsabers'
laser blades, high five and huggle the queen. The queen smiles, hands them the
crossbows to study and each jedi examines his crossbow, discussing them with the
queen.

A tagline appears on the screen as a mock commercial:

“<b>PersonalQrossBow's 2-in-1 Pocketbow kit. Why not have both?</b>”

Natalie Portman's voice from behind: and — cut! Great job everyone!

[

The actors of Worf and Gowron rise from their place. Tiffany Alvord
is smiling relieved and shakes the hands of the 4 male actors
and hugs them compassionately. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman_filmography">Natalie Portman</a> (= the
director, and the actress who had originally played Queen Amidala in the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Prequel_trilogy">original

]

Natalie: [to Tiffany] I knew you had it in you. [They hug].

Wayne's voice from a different frame: Dude! This sucks.

[ Split frame with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne%27s_World_(film)">Wayne and Garth</a>
sitting in an untidy room next to a computer screen.
They are the plot programmers. ]

Wayne: …I left you alone asking you to write a draft for a feature about
ethical hacking for PBS, and you come up with this??

Garth: What's wrong with it?

Wayne: It's the old missile-vs-melee paradigm! Thrown in a Star Wars / Star Trek
crossover and "girl power" and stuff. Every 2nd hand fan fic writer could
have written it in three days!

Garth: Took me less than an hour, after lunch, before playing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>…

Wayne: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQALLGsn-Fk">Beginners' luck</a>,
I guess.

+++: Anyway, who's gonna play the Queen, Natalie Portman?

Garth: nah… we asked her and she wanted too much money. So we went with
Tiffany Alvord, man!

[ Tiffany looks angry, crosses her hands and glances at Natalie with disapproval. ]

Wayne: Dude, are you freaking kidding me? She's like <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/Summer-Glau-and-Chuck-Norris.html#venting_is_us">the Fluttershy of YouTube musicians</a>. Do you ever see <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Fluttershy">Fluttershy</a> using a machine gun?

[ Fluttershy is seen flying, using a machine gun to shoot at a terrified <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Rainbow_Dash">Rainbow Dash</a> who
just robbed a bank, and trying to shoot back at Fluttershy using a smaller one hand gun. As she leaves the frame, Fluttershy stops and winks at the camera. ]

Wayne: Next thing you tell me, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift">Taylor Swift</a> can get away with being shown laying waste to a whole city in a videoclip.

Garth: but, but…

]

Wayne: no "but"s, Garth, dude.

+++: OK, enough about the Queen, who's the director? Is it going to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas">George Lucas</a>?

Garth: nah, he also ended up wanting too much. We ended up hiring Natalie Portman instead.

[

Natalie Portman is resentful and disappointed. Tiffany is smiling
from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude">Schadenfreude</a>.

]

Wayne: OK, not ideal but we can work with that.

+++: Anyway, you do realise that one of these "throwaway" jedi knights could just
hurl his lightsaber at the Klingon warrior throat like a spear, right?

[ The 5 main actors and Natalie seem contemplative. ]

Garth: ah… didn't think about it.

Wayne: we can use that to our advantage. Let me tell you, plot programming
could use some <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Applejack%27s_%22Day%22_Off">code review</a>
too. You could have requested this on Internet forums before you started playing Dwarf Fortress.

Garth: dude, you're right!

Wayne: let's rework the plot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">together</a>.
What you did is not too bad for a beginner and I believe in delegating responsibility and decision-making,
But we can do a better ethical hacking film.

<s id="film-crew-ungathers" title="The film crew disassembles">

[ All the film personnel in the filming room sigh and shake their head. ]

Natalie: sorry, everybody… [looks at Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash who float in mid-air peacefully] and everypony.

Rainbow Dash: No worries, Nat! We can make the scene at least 100% more awesome.

Natalie: Right, Rainbow Dash [she pats her head.]. OK, everyone, we need to wait for the plot
programmers to write the new version. We may still be able to reuse some of the
filmed material, but probably we're going to have a lot of work to do.

+++: In the meanwhile, get changed to normal clothes, go home, and I'll give you guys
3 day notices on all the relevant electronic media. Sorry.

+++: Oh, and happy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah">Hanukkah</a>!

[ Tiffany has already taken off the Queen Padmé outfit and is wearing a T-shirt
and jeans. ]

Tiffany: the outfit was itchy.

Natalie: mine was too back when I had to wear it back for the Star Wars prequels.

+++: Anyway, can I invite you to lunch?

Tiffany: Sure! I'm so hungry I could eat a horse!

[ Fluttershy gasps. ]

Tiffany: It's just an expression, Flutteroo! I'm not <b>that</b> crazy.

[ Fluttershy is relieved ; Rainbow Dash extends her tongue towards her.

Tiffany pats both their heads one by one. ]

Natalie: What do you want to eat?

Tiffany: I think I'll have some noodles.

Natalie: No problem! I know a nice general café/restaurant just across the road, with
a large selection of noodles' dishes. Probably not authentic, but good enough
for a Westerner.

+++: as for me, I think I ate too much at breakfast, so I think I'll have a juice or a soda
or both, heh.

Tiffany: which ones?

Natalie: I'll just go down the waitors' recommendations heh. Oh -
and I wanna have some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latke">Latkes</a>!

Tiffany: oh, I want some Latkes too…

Note that I am offering up to 3,000 USD for
a video version of the first <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/kaajb9/commission_fluttershy_as_queen_amidala_of_the/">stanza</a>
which can be either animated or live action, and whose quality I
am happy with.

[

Despite what the screenplay jokes about, Tiffany Alvord is my first choice to play
the Selinaverse's Padmé, in part because she has much better Internet Read/Write
web, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/web20.html">web 2.0</a> /
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social-media">social media</a>
presence than Natalie Portman does at present (which she may or may not
opt to remedy), which is essential for the future screenplays.
I wouldn't mind George Lucas codirecting or coproducing this series in effect, but
Portman seems better somehow.

[ The filming set. ]

Natalie: everyone in position…and - action!

[ Worf and Gowron growl. The two closest Jedi knights quickly pull
two black blasters and aim them at the Klingons; Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon do the same. ]

The Jedi Knights: hands up!

[ The Klingons comply. ]

Queen Padme: [using her smartphone as a loud speaker.] Dear Klingon sirs…
what did you intend to do?

Worf: we were hired to kill you and our plan has failed. We thought using
missiles would be too cowardly.

+++: Nevertheless…it is against
the Klingon ethos to retreat from a battle nonvictorious, so please
kill us now, and if you wish, torture us beforhand.

[ Worf and Gowron close their eyes. Padmé sighs.]

Padmé: OK… let's suppose for the sake of argumentation that my jedi knights
and I have killed you (or <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/">slain</a>
you), that you have died (or admitted you were wrong) and were reborn.
Will this be acceptable?

[ Worf and Gowron smile, then laugh, open their eyes and are
relieved. ]

Gowron: you were a truly worthy opponent your majesty!
What should we do next?

Padmé: [uses her smartphone. Shows Darth Vader on the screen]
Hey uncle Vader! Guess what? We found the assassins and they
have been reborn. We're going to chat with them and get some
"intel" out about their clients. But tell aunt Liz to be
the ceremonial female royal in the Jedi tournament instead
of me.

Vader: sure thing, Padpad! May the force be with you.

Padmé: [to Worf and Gowron] OK, you seem to be noble and think highly
of me now. What prompted you to attempt to assassinate me?

Worf: we accumulated debt… wine, song and the wrong kind of women.
So Gowron and I started a mercenerying side-business. We
were offered a large amount of money to assassinate you,
which we accepted after reading your Wikipedia page,
which gave us the impression that you were some kind of power,
fame, and money hungry politician, tyrant, and celebrity.

Padmé: A power, fame, and money hungry politician, tyrant, and celebrity?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNYI3iINXrQ">Why, thank you!</a>

[ They laugh. ]

Padmé: OK, seriously now: I had my share of frustrations from
that page, which is kind of a "can't see the forest from the trees"
syndrome, and being a royal doesn't help (and I'll gladly pass the
crown to someone I can trust, but noone volunteered so far.)

+++: Anyway, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon will escort you to the palace's
café where you can find an open wifi, some tablets, a screen,
and a digital camera, and can order <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#amateur-modelled-commerce">free food</a>.

+++: Please give them the identity of your client, primarily for
their own good. Once you arrive there, I suggest you start reading
my bio on my personal website and my FAQ.

[ Rainbow Dash and <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Big_McIntosh">Big Mac</a>
materialise out of thin air carrying large blasters. ]

Rainbow Dash: We'll make sure they do not leave the palace's premises!

Big Mac: ayyup!

Padmé: Oh Lord! Are you trying to scare people though?

Gowron: Rainbow, Big Mac: to quote <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Kahless_the_Unforgettable">Kahless the Unforgettable</a>:
“Only the most timid of warriors shall attempt to evade an opportunity of peaceful enlightenment.”.
We have no intention to escape, and surely you can outrun… or outfly us.

Rainbow Dash: Fair enough, <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Discord">Discord</a>, please
take care of these blasters.

[ Discord appears, snaps his fingers and convert Rainbow Dash's and Big Mac's blasters
into a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mirror+dice&amp;atb=v140-1&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">Mirror Dice</a>
-like ornament. ]

Discord: These will look great on my new <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Podracer">podracer</a>.

[ He flies in a podracer not unlike the Star Wars Ep. 1's Anakin Skywalker's podracer
, with scarves and sunglasses
similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelma_%26_Louise">Thelma &amp; Louise</a>
and does a U-turn. ]

Padmé: Well, I need to go to my room and change. This ceremonial robe is
itchy. I'm going to need one of you Jedi knights' gentlemen to escort
me. I have my own blaster here, but still will need a body guard in
the unlikely case that there are going to be more assassins.
