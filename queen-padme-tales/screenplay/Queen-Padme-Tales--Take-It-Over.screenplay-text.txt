<s id="about-objective" title="Objective">

[

An illustrated screenplay crossing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars%3A_Episode_I_%E2%80%93_The_Phantom_Menace">Star Wars Ep. I</a>,
the <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse">Selinaverse</a> (itself
crossing Star Trek TNG/DS9, Buffy, Judaism, Israel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)">Objectivism</a>, etc.)
the real world online/offline life in 2010s/2020s,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a>.

This screenplay <b>is not</b> written in the Hollywood blessed format because
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/hacking-heroism.xhtml">good
hackers (= resourceful and rule bending heroes)</a>
which include the talented actors and actresses in this film can
withstand reading a raw and non-CSS-styled XHTML5 file. That - and hackers like me
do not have the time to massage a screenplay into Hollywood's whimsical
format only to be rejected, rinse and repeat.

Padmé: so, Emma, what brings you to Naboo?

EmmaWatson: I want to destroy you!

Padmé: eh… what?!

EmmaWatson: I am running "Madame Y Not" a.k.a "Madame Not Y" to
Naboo's crown.

Padmé: is she a citizen of Naboo?

EmmaWatson: she claims she is.

Padmé: I don't presume these are her real names.

EmmaWatson: They are not.

Padmé: Sounds fishy.

EmmaWatson: alright, alright, Madame Y Not a.k.a Madame Not Y, is not going to
run for Naboo's Queen.'

[ An amorphous blob gets out of EmmaWatson's body. <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Discord">Discord</a>, dressed as Sherlock Holmes appears and cages it. ]

EmmaWatson: oh my goodness,… What was happening to me? I wouldn't run a mystery woman for Naboo's crown… hell, on normal days I'll even refuse running for the UK or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGXx56WqqJw">French</a> parliaments.

[ Looks at the caged blob. ]

EmmaWatson: What the hell is that?

Discord: elementary, Ms. Watson, my darling, <a href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/elementary-my-dear-watson.html">elementary</a>! [ He blows some bubbles out of a soap bubbles' pipe]

EmmaWatson: pray continue with your narrative, Mr. Discord!

Discord: What we see here is a quad-thermal, meta-tachionic, temporally phenomenic, geodesic, tri-phasic…

EmmaWatson: any idea what it all means?

Discord: <a href="https://ozyandmillie.org/comic/ozy-and-millie-1308/">not the slightest</a>!

+++: However, by applying a gentle electron shower, we get [the blob is reduced to reveal <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Pinkie_Pie">Pinkie Pie</a>]… Pinkie Pie!

Pinkie Pie: Whoa! What happened? Wait… I recall taking a guided tour of <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Beckyverse">Beckyverse</a>, then reading an ancient curse, and then:

+++: I possessed EmmaWatson's body and… [starts crying] ran for Naboo's crown. [ She weeps. ]

Fluttershy emerges.

Fluttershy: oh, Pinkie, how could you?

EmmaWatson: And that will teach me to not pick up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkElfR_NPBI">books with a strange glow</a> from old book stores in London.

Padmé: Discord, was that your orchestration?

Discord: I'll take the fifth [counts only up to four using his 4 fingered palm.].

Padmé: OK, Emma, let me blog that the whole crisis is hopefully over; it harmed
your online/offline presence more than it harmed Naboo, but it did uncover some
loopholes in the Naboo policies.

EmmaWatson: yeah! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson">the sweet emerged from the mighty</a>.
