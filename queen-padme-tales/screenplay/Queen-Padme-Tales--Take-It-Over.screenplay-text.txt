<s id="about-objective" title="Objective">

[

An illustrated screenplay crossing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars%3A_Episode_I_%E2%80%93_The_Phantom_Menace">Star Wars Ep. I</a>,
the <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse">Selinaverse</a> (itself
crossing Star Trek TNG/DS9, Buffy, Judaism, Israel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)">Objectivism</a>, etc.)
the real world online/offline life in 2010s/2020s,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a>.

This screenplay <b>is not</b> written in the Hollywood blessed format because
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/hacking-heroism.xhtml">good
hackers (= resourceful and rule bending heroes)</a>
which include the talented actors and actresses in this film can
withstand reading a raw and non-CSS-styled XHTML5 file. That - and hackers like me
do not have the time to massage a screenplay into Hollywood's whimsical
format only to be rejected, rinse and repeat.

Padmé: so, Emma, what brings you to Naboo?

Emma Watson: I want to destroy you!

Padmé: eh… what?!

Emma Watson: I am running "Madame Y Not" a.k.a "Madame Not Y" to
Naboo's crown.

Padmé: is she a citizen of Naboo?

Emma Watson: she claims she is.

Padmé: I don't presume these are her real names.

Emma Watson: They are not.

Padmé: Sounds fishy.

[ Cut to the office of Daniel, Padmé's cousin and legal advisor. ]

Daniel: I'm afraid to say that running a mystery woman who claims
to be a citizen of Naboo is possible under the current bylaws.
This is one case where I wish the law will be amended, even though
Padmé and I are passionate about trimming the Naboo's bylaws from
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/#guidelines_as_dogma">superfluous regulations</a>.

Padmé: well, I'm running for the crown again.

Emma Watson: and I'm starting my campaign with the slogan "Queen Padmé royally sucks! Vote 'Madame Y Not'!"

Julian Bashir: well, Ms. Watson seems in perfect health physically, but her
mind is possesed by a spirit.

Jadzia Dax: and it has a signature of the Beckyverse.

Deanna Troi: from what I can sense, that spirit is not malevolent, just cursed and feels scared and trapped.

Padmé: can we use technology to remove it?

George the Cat: Unfortunately, it is beyond the reach of even the Q Continuum. (Plot device!)

+++: However, I suggest you consult with <a href="https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Enyos">Enyos of the Kalderash</a> from the Beckyverse. He may have some insights about psychological exorcism.

<s id="talk-with-Enyos-about-helping-Emma-Watson" title="Talk with Enyos">

[ Padmé's computer says "Initiating Selinaverse⬄Beckyverse bridge"
and after a while shows Enyos' face wearing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_hat">straw hat</a> and
a smaller live recording of Emma Watson of the Beckyverse.]

Padmé: hey Enyos and Emma! Thanks for agreeing to talk with me on such
a short notice.

Enyos: No problem, your majesty.

Emma Watson of the Beckyverse: yeah! I've been feeling the heat from the
Selinaverse's Emma Watson too.

Padmé: OK, what do you suggest to do about the possessing spirit?

Enyos: Well, psychologically, a possession is no different from a natural
but irrational obsession. An effective way of dealing with it is to
prove to the obsessed that he or she cannot reasonably achieve what they wish.

Padmé: thank you, Enyos. By the way, I see you have a different hat this time.

Enyos: yes, I'm on vacation in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados">Barbados</a> - currently sitting in a local bar.

Padmé: Why aren't you speaking from a graveyard?

Enyos: heh, that's a custom that <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Accession_(episode)">the Sisko would call 'past'</a>.

<s id="proving-Padme-will-win" title="Proving Padmé Will Probably Win">

Emma Watson: Hey! Did you want to see me?

Padmé: Yes, Emma! See - we conducted an online poll using open source
software with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant">proved
correctness</a> and over 90 percent of Naboo's voters took part in. Out of
them, over 98% noted they intend to vote <b>and</b> vote for me.

+++: So the bottom line is that Madame Y Not is probably not going
to be elected barring demonic/etc. intervention.

Emma Watson: alright, alright, Madame Y Not a.k.a Madame Not Y, is not going to
run for Naboo's Queen.'

[ An amorphous blob gets out of Emma Watson's body. <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Discord">Discord</a>, dressed as Sherlock Holmes appears and cages it. ]

Emma Watson: oh my goodness,… What was happening to me? I wouldn't run a mystery woman for Naboo's crown… hell, on normal days I'll even refuse running for the UK or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGXx56WqqJw">French</a> parliaments.

[ Looks at the caged blob. ]

Emma Watson: What the hell is that?

Discord: elementary, Ms. Watson, my darling, <a href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/elementary-my-dear-watson.html">elementary</a>! [ He blows some bubbles out of a soap bubbles' pipe]

Emma Watson: pray continue with your narrative, Mr. Discord!

Discord: What we see here is a quad-thermal, meta-tachionic, temporally phenomenic, geodesic, tri-phasic…

Emma Watson: any idea what it all means?

Discord: <a href="https://ozyandmillie.org/comic/ozy-and-millie-1308/">not the slightest</a>!

Pinkie Pie: Whoa! What happened? Wait… I recall taking a guided tour of <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Beckyverse">Beckyverse</a>, then reading an ancient curse, and then:

Fluttershy: oh, Pinkie, how could you?

Emma Watson: And that will teach me to not pick up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkElfR_NPBI">books with a strange glow</a> from old book stores in London.

Padmé: Discord, was that your orchestration?

Discord: I'll take the fifth [counts only up to four using his 4 fingered palm.].

Padmé: OK, Emma, let me blog that the whole crisis is hopefully over; it harmed
your online/offline presence more than it harmed Naboo, but it did uncover some
loopholes in the Naboo policies.

Emma Watson: yeah! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson">the sweet emerged from the mighty</a>.
