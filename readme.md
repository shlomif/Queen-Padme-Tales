I have a nice idea for a next logical evolution of
[David vs. Goliath](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/DocBook5/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/david_and_goliath.xhtml) / [Indiana Jones gun vs. swordsman scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YyBtMxZgQs) / missile weapon vs. melee story structure.

[Queen Padmé Amidala](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala) (Star Wars Ep. 1) is in a corridor with the young [Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi) and his jedi mentor ( [Qui-Gon Jinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui-Gon_Jinn) ) guarding her with light sabers. On the ends there are two armored but unarmed [Klingon](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Klingon) (Star Trek) warriors who fight against a metric ton of "throwaway" lightsabered jedi warriors who rush from the middle to try to take the malevolent Klingons out of the equation somehow. The Klingons have immense strength, agility and use basic and advanced martial arts tactics: kicking the jedis in the crotch; poking their eyes out, stabbing them with their own lightsabers, pushing them onto each other's laser swords in cascade, etc.

Eventually the lesser Jedis are all dead or wounded, and the Klingons rush towards the trio screaming battle cries. The queen looks startled and frightened while Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are trying to prepare tensly and without much hope to win.

The queen's face becomes tense and focused, she pulls two small crossbows from her waist, looks to her right, aims, and shoots an arrow at the Klingon warrior's neck; then she turns her head to the left, aims and shoots. The two Klingons warriors are hit by arrows in their neck, grab them with both hands, fall to their knees and bleed to death falling on the floor.

The two Jedis protagonists are relieved, disable their lightsabers' laser blades, high five and huggle the queen. The queen hands them the crossbows to study and they inspect one crossbow each, discussing them with the queen.

A tagline appears on the screen as a mock commercial: **PersonalQrossBow's 2-in-1 Pocketbow kit. Why not have both?** ( https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexlee/porque-no-los-dos )
