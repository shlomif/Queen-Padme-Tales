This is an idea for a next logical evolution of
[David vs. Goliath](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/DocBook5/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/david_and_goliath.xhtml) / [Indiana Jones' gun vs. swordsman scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YyBtMxZgQs) / missile weapon vs. melee story structure.

## The Story

[Queen Padmé Amidala](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala) (Star Wars Ep. 1) is in a corridor with the young [Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi) and his jedi mentor ( [Qui-Gon Jinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui-Gon_Jinn) ) guarding her with light sabers. On the ends there are two armored but unarmed [Klingon](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Klingon) (Star Trek) warriors who fight against a metric ton of "throwaway" lightsabered jedi warriors who rush from the middle to try to take the malevolent Klingons out of the equation somehow. The Klingons have immense strength, agility and use basic and advanced martial arts tactics: kicking the jedis in the crotch; poking their eyes out, stabbing them with their own lightsabers, pushing them onto each other's laser swords in cascade, etc.

Eventually the lesser Jedis are all dead or wounded, and the Klingons rush towards the trio screaming battle cries. The queen looks startled and frightened while Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are trying to prepare tensly and without much hope to win.

The queen's face becomes tense and focused, she pulls two small crossbows from her waist, looks to her right, aims, and shoots an arrow at the Klingon warrior's neck; then she turns her head to the left, aims and shoots. The two Klingons warriors are hit by arrows in their neck, grab them with both hands, fall to their knees and bleed to death falling on the floor.

The two Jedis protagonists are relieved, laugh, disable their lightsabers' laser blades, high five and huggle the queen. The queen hands them the crossbows to study and they inspect one crossbow each, discussing them with the queen.

A tagline appears on the screen as a mock commercial: **PersonalQrossBow's 2-in-1 Pocketbow kit. Why not have both?** ( https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexlee/porque-no-los-dos )

## Dedication

This story is dedicated to the memory of [Christina Grimmie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie) (1994-2016),
a remarkable singer and youtuber, who was killed at age 22 by a fan who was obsessed with her, who almost immediately committed suicide himself.

## Reflections

I think almost every young-at-heart lady (of almost any age) can be the queen and, after
some amount of hacking, also every young-at-heart gentleman (e.g: by replacing her with
[young Anakin Skywalker](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker)).

That put aside, I'd love to see the queen played by [Tiffany Alvord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Alvord),
who is a singer, songwriter and budding actress, who has testified to be
shy in real-life and has a good girl image (while often being spectacularly bold and
magnetic in her music videos) Play Queen Amidala her. I think she has a "badass asskicker"
side to her personality (e.g [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gxvMi6yekg)
and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kihnB6M4Hzs)) and you can
[kick ass non-violently and non-destructively](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/) ).

A friend noted that some people may be angry by mixing up Star Wars and Star Trek,
but he was amused. If you want to be even angrier, see [this image macro](https://absurdlynerdly.wordpress.com/2011/10/19/use-the-force-harry/).

----

The ironic thing about the story is that any of the expendable jedis could
have thrown his lightsaber like a spear at his respective klingon's necks. I'm planning
to use this fact at a self-rebuttal in which Amidala handles the situation
using [Saladin-style](http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/)
benevolent psychological warfare without any bloodshed.

----

I decided to use crossbows instead of [Star Wars' laser blasters](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Blaster/Legends) for the
ranged weapons for the extra "back-to-basics" effect. An online friend agreed that it is a good idea, but
your kilometrage may vary.

----

This is likely not going to be the final word in the missile-vs-melee theme. You
can read my interpretation of the significance of the original tale in
[a section of an essay](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/DocBook5/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/david_and_goliath.xhtml).

If you believe I should not have used elements from 3rd party franchises,
or that I should have only used elements from the [Jewish "Torah"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah)
, I advise you to read and follow the links from my
["make your own kind of music"](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/make-your-own-kind-of-music.xhtml)
mini essay. That put aside, if you think you can make better music, either
based on mine or not, then go for it.

[Bandali](https://github.com/notbandali) for introducing me to the ["Porque no los dos" (= "Why can't we have both?")](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexlee/porque-no-los-dos) meme, which was one of
the final catalysts for writing this.
