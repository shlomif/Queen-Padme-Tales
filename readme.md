«I have a nice idea for a next logical evolution of 
David vs. Goliath / Indiana Jones gun vs. swordsman scene // missile vs. melee (https://www.shlomifish.org/.../david_and_goliath.xhtml ) story structure.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala (star wars i-iii) is in a corridor with obi-wan kenobi and his jedi mentor ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui-Gon_Jinn ) guarding her with light sabers. On the ends there are two armored but unarmed Klingons ( https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Klingon (star-trek)) arriors who fight against a metric ton of "throwaway" lightsabered jedi warriors who rush from the middle to try to take them out of the equation somehow. The Klingons have immense strength, agility and use basic and advanced martial arts tactics: kicking the jedis in the crotch; poking their eyes, stabbing them with their own lightsabers, pushing them onto each other's laser swords in cascade, etc.

Eventually the lesser jedis are all dead or wounded, and the Klingons rush towards the trio screaming battle cries. The queen looks startled and frightened while obi-wan and Qui-Gon are trying to prepare tensly and without much hope.
 
The queen's face becomes tense and focused, she pulls two small crossbows from her waist, and shoots both Klingons in the neck simultaneously. The two Klingons warriors grab their neck, fall to their knees and bleed fatally.

The two Jedis protagonists are relieved, disable their lightsabers' blade, high five and huggle the queen and study and faux aim one crossbow each.
